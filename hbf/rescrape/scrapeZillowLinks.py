# Currently, this scraper function cannot scrape information from Zillow web pages that use
# Java Script to subsequently load webpage details. Java Script transactions on a webpage delay the download
# of information (i.e. details are not shown until user clicks an "expand" button) which results in the
# HTTP request not obtaining a "full" response from the server. Selenium WebDriver could be used as a solution
# to query these JS pages in order to fully acquire all information on a web page.
